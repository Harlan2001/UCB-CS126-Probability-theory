# UCB EECS126: Probability and Random Processes

The advanced course of Probability Theory in Berkeley involves the relatively in-depth content of statistics, random process and other theories, which requires a considerable mathematical foundation. I also felt a little difficult to take this course, but it will certainly make you grasp probability theory to a new height if you stick to it.

At the same time, this course emphasizes the combination of theory and practice. The course designer Professor Jean Walrand specially wrote a supporting textbook, Probability in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,Each chapter of the book will take a specific algorithm practice as an example to demonstrate the application of theory in practice, such as PageRank, Route Planing, Speech Recognition and so on

That's not all. Jean Walrand has designed a companion Python implementation for the examples throughout the book, which is published online as a Jupyter Notebook for readers to modify, debug, and run online.Meanwhile, in addition to the theory work, there are nine programming assignments in this course that will allow you to use your knowledge of probability theory to solve practical problems.
